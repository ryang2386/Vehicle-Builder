## Description
Do you want to have fun creating your own vehicle and performing several actions with it? If so, this project accomplishes that feat! This program allows you to create your own vehicle and perform several different funcions with it.

 ## Installation
First, install Typescript in your Terminal by typing "npm install -D typescript". Once Typescript is installed, install the inquirer package by typing in "npm i inquirer". After the inquirer package is installed, type "npm start" to run the program.

 ## Usage
This project can be used by anyone who wants to have some fun creating different vehicles, such as a car, truck, or motorbike, and performing several actions with it. Also, each vehicle has actions that only it can perform (for example: only a truck can tow other vehicles).
